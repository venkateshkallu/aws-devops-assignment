# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create pipeline directory structure and move workflow files
  - Move existing ci-cd.yml from .github/workflows/ to pipeline/ directory
  - Preserve existing trust-policy.json in pipeline directory
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Implement symbolic link synchronization mechanism
  - Create symbolic link from .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml to pipeline/ci-cd.yml
  - Test symbolic link functionality on current system
  - Verify GitHub Actions can discover and execute the linked workflow
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Create workflow synchronization script
  - Write sync-workflows.sh script in pipeline directory
  - Implement cross-platform compatibility (Linux/macOS/Windows)
  - Add error handling and validation for sync operations
  - Include functionality to detect and repair broken links
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 4. Add workflow validation and testing
  - Implement YAML syntax validation for workflow files
  - Create test script to verify workflow integrity
  - Add pre-commit hook configuration for automatic validation
  - Test workflow execution after restructuring
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [ ] 5. Update documentation and project references
  - Update README.md to reflect new folder structure
  - Add instructions for managing workflows in pipeline directory
  - Update any path references in existing documentation
  - Create developer guidelines for workflow management
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement fallback mechanism for cross-platform compatibility
  - Add detection for systems that don't support symbolic links
  - Implement file copying as fallback synchronization method
  - Create automated sync process for fallback scenarios
  - Test functionality on different operating systems
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Create maintenance and monitoring utilities
  - Write script to check sync status and integrity
  - Implement automated sync verification
  - Add logging and error reporting for sync operations
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Clean up repository structure and organize files
  - Delete the root .github folder (no longer needed after symbolic link approach)
  - Move root-level files to appropriate directories (.gitignore, ecs update-service, new-task-def.json, package-lock.json)
  - Organize files according to project structure standards
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 9. Commit and push changes to main branch
  - Stage all changes made during restructuring
  - Commit changes with descriptive message
  - Push to main branch to trigger GitHub Actions and verify functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_
