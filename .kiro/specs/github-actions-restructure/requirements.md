# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to restructure the repository's GitHub Actions workflows to align with the desired folder structure while maintaining CI/CD functionality. The current `.github/workflows` structure needs to be reorganized to place workflow files in the `pipeline` directory as specified in the project documentation, while ensuring GitHub Actions can still discover and execute the workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to organize GitHub Actions workflows in the pipeline directory, so that the repository structure matches the documented architecture and maintains consistency with other pipeline-related files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is restructured THEN the `.github/workflows` directory SHALL be moved to maintain GitHub Actions functionality
2. WHEN workflows are organized THEN they SHALL be accessible from the `pipeline` directory structure
3. WHEN the restructure is complete THEN GitHub Actions SHALL continue to trigger automatically on push to main branch
4. WHEN the new structure is implemented THEN the repository SHALL match the documented folder structure in README.md

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub Actions to continue working seamlessly after restructuring, so that the CI/CD pipeline remains functional without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN GitHub Actions workflows SHALL trigger automatically
2. WHEN workflows execute THEN they SHALL successfully build and deploy the application
3. WHEN the restructure is complete THEN all existing workflow functionality SHALL be preserved
4. IF workflows fail to trigger THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the repository structure to be clearly documented and consistent, so that new contributors can easily understand the project organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the restructure is complete THEN the README.md SHALL accurately reflect the new folder structure
2. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include clear instructions for workflow management
3. WHEN the project structure changes THEN all references to file paths SHALL be updated accordingly
4. WHEN new workflows are added THEN they SHALL follow the established organizational pattern

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to maintain backward compatibility and easy migration, so that the restructuring process doesn't break existing deployments or require complex manual interventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restructuring is implemented THEN existing deployments SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN migration occurs THEN it SHALL be reversible if issues arise
3. WHEN changes are made THEN they SHALL not require updates to AWS infrastructure
4. WHEN the new structure is in place THEN it SHALL support future workflow additions seamlessly
